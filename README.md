# Udacity Data ANalysis Project 1

### This is my first project for the udacity data analysis Nanodegree

# Technologies
Python and its libraries such as Numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib are used

# Description
The goal of this project is to analyse one of the 5 or 6 datasets provided in the udacity classroom using
the following Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. The data is meant to be explored, then come up with at least three questions and answer them using the libraries. The specific dataset I use in this project is "No-show appointments". It is about whether or not patients show up for appointment. I ask 3 questions, but the major one is the one that have shows whether patients shows up or not for the hospital appointment. I analyze the data and answered all the 3 questions
